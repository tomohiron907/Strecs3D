## Overview

Strecs3D is a preprocessing software that generates optimized infill for 3D printing based on structural analysis results. It automatically sets dense infill for areas under stress and sparse infill for areas without stress, achieving both material savings and strength optimization.

## Key Features

- **Visualization of Structural Analysis Results**: Load stress distribution from VTK files and display in 3D
- **Stress-based Region Segmentation**: Automatically segment 3D models based on stress thresholds
- **Variable Density Infill Generation**: Set infill density according to stress levels
- **Slicer Compatibility**: Export 3MF files compatible with Cura and Bambu Studio

## Installation

### 1. Download Release Version
1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tomohiron907/Strecs3D/releases)
2. Download according to your OS:
   - **Windows**: `Strecs3D-Windows-Installer.exe`
   - **macOS**: `Strecs3D-macOS.dmg`

### 2. Installation

#### Windows
```bash
# Run the downloaded installer
# Follow the installation wizard
# A shortcut will be created on the desktop
```

#### macOS
```bash
# 1. Open the downloaded DMG file
# 2. Drag & drop the Strecs3D application to the Applications folder
# 3. Launch from Applications
```

## Usage

### 1. Prepare Files

**Input Files**
- `STL` file: 3D model exported from CAD software (binary format only)
- `VTU` file: Analysis results exported from structural analysis software

### 2. Basic Workflow

**Step 1: Import Files**
1. Launch Strecs3D
2. Select STL file with "Open Stl File"
3. Import VTU file similarly

**Step 2: Set Stress Thresholds**
1. Check the stress distribution
2. Use the density slider to set infill density for each stress level
3. Preview the result

**Step 3: Select Slicer**
- Cura: Standard 3MF output
- Bambu Studio: Optimized output for Bambu Studio

**Step 4: Execute Processing**
1. Click the `Process` button
2. Confirm region segmentation
3. Export the file with `Export 3MF`

**Step 5: Use in Slicer**
1. Load the exported 3MF file in your slicer
2. Slice as usual
3. Infill patterns based on stress distribution will be generated

## Troubleshooting

> **Frequently Asked Questions and Solutions**

- **Q: Cannot load STL file**
  - A: Only binary format STL files are supported. If you have ASCII format, please convert it to binary in your CAD software.
- **Q: Cannot load VTU file**
  - A: Please ensure the file is in VTK VTU format. For other formats, conversion to VTK format is required.
- **Q: Cannot load 3MF file in slicer**
  - A: Please confirm that your slicer supports the 3MF format.
- **Q: Error occurs during processing**
  - A: The file size might be too large. Check memory usage and simplify the model if necessary.
